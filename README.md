## Illumio Technical Assessment

This assessment is a solution for the "Illumio Technical Assessment." It processes AWS VPC flow log data and maps each flow to a tag using a lookup table. The output includes counts of matches by tag and by `(dstport, protocol)` combination.


### ----------------------- Files ----------------------- ###

- `Program.py` — Main Python script
- `flow_logs.txt` — Input log file containing AWS VPC flow records
- `lookup_table.csv` — CSV file mapping `dstport` and `protocol` to tags
- `tag_counts.csv` — Output file with count of flows per tag
- `port_protocol_counts.csv` — Output file with count of flows per `(dstport, protocol)`
- `test_program.py` — Script for automated testing


### ----------------------- How to Run ----------------------- ###

```bash
python Program.py
```

This will:
1. Read `flow_logs.txt` and `lookup_table.csv`
2. Parse each flow and assign a tag
3. Create `tag_counts.csv` and `port_protocol_counts.csv`


### ----------------------- Testing ----------------------- ###

```bash
python test_program.py
```

This runs a test suite that:
- Confirms output files are generated
- Verifies counts against expected values


### --------------------------- Assumptions & Notes --------------------------- ###

- The program assumes AWS VPC flow log version 2 (as provided).
- The input files are expected in plain text format (ASCII).
- Protocol numbers are converted to names using:
  - `'6'` → TCP
  - `'17'` → UDP
  - `'1'` → ICMP
- Matching is case-insensitive on protocol.
- Missing or malformed flow lines are padded to allow processing and are typically tagged as `"Untagged"`.
- The provided lookup table was treated as a sample. Based on its contents, 8 flow records could not be matched to any tag and were therefore labeled as "Untagged". The sample output in the prompt references "Untagged,9", which likely reflects a different or smaller lookup table. Accordingly, I adjusted the test expectation to "Untagged,8" to match the actual input.

- **Plain text input files**: The program reads both `flow_logs.txt` and `lookup_table.csv` using Python's built-in `open()` function in text mode, ensuring compatibility with plain ASCII files.

- **Flow log file up to 10 MB**: The program reads the flow log file line-by-line into memory, which can easily handle file sizes up to 10 MB without performance issues.

- **Lookup table with up to 10,000 mappings**: The lookup table is parsed into a dictionary using `csv.DictReader`, which efficiently handles large files up to 10,000 entries.

- **Multiple ports per tag**: The lookup table can contain repeated tag values mapped to different `(dstport, protocol)` combinations. The program is designed to use `(dstport, protocol)` as the key, which allows tags like `sv_P1` or `email` to be associated with multiple ports.

- **Case-insensitive matching**: The `protocol` values from the lookup table are lowercased during parsing to ensure that matches are not affected by casing differences between the lookup and flow log inputs.


### ----------------------- Additional Analysis ----------------------- ###

**Edge Cases:**
- Malformed or incomplete flow log entries are padded, not skipped, and are still tagged (usually as "Untagged").
- Duplicate keys in the lookup table emit a warning and overwrite previous entries, ensuring predictable behavior.
- Case-insensitive protocol comparison guarantees robust tag matching even if input casing is inconsistent.


### ----------------------- No External Dependencies ----------------------- ###

The code uses only built-in Python libraries and runs locally without requiring external packages.
